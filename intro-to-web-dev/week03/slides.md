## Lecture and Activities

### WHAT IS CSS FLEXBOX? 
* A CSS layout model
* Allows us to design web pages with responsive layouts. 
  * Containers expands items with to fill available free space.
  * Prevents overflowing of elements on the web pages.

### CSS FLEXBOX
* HTML elements in CSS Flexbox act as boxes embedded within each other.
* How many boxes are in the image shown?
* Work from the outside to the inside; biggest to smallest.

### PARENT/CHILD ELEMENTS 
* We refer to elements that contain other elements as parent elements
* The element inside is referred to as a child element
* Example: In the first image, div is the parent, while p is the child of div.
* Which elements are parents and children in the second image?

### FLEXBOX FROGGY 
* Flexbox Froggy is a game that allows you to practice flexbox properties.
* The frogs and the lily pads in the pond act just as elements on a web page do.
